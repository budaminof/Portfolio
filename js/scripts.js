Grasp gives teachers a live visualization of the overall level of student understanding, and gives the students the ability to anonymously communicate their level of understanding with the teacher in real-time. With this real-time data teachers can gauge exactly where in the lecture students struggle. The mobile app, build with Ionic, lets students change the status of their comprehension during a lecture, which updates a graph in the teacherâ€™s view, using Sockets.io. The teacher also has the ability to review graphs from previous lectures. ",
