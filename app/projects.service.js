Grasp gives teachers a live visualization of the overall level of student understanding, and gives the students the ability to anonymously communicate their level of understanding with the teacher in real-time. With this real-time data teachers can gauge exactly where in the lecture students struggle. The mobile app, build with Ionic, lets students change the status of their comprehension during a lecture, which updates a graph in the teacherâ€™s view, using Sockets.io. The teacher also has the ability to review graphs from previous lectures. If you want to login and look around, user name: 'user2@example.com', password: 'password'.",

Usually, you will have at least 3 tabs open: one or more for a list of events, one with a music sample so you can decide if are you really going to listen to this band  for an hour, and another tab for directions. In this app, you can do all of this dance on one page. I think that this is pretty good for a first project.",
